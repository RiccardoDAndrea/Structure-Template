# Structure-Template
Inspired by [Cookiecutter](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) 


This repository provides us with a structure for every repository that we have.
The main purpose is to maintain clarity and organization to understand what is happening in the file structure.

In the file [Structure_docs.md](https://github.com/RiccardoDAndrea/Structure-Template/blob/main/Strucuture_docs.md) you'll find documentation for the template.
